    "talk_title": "Modular Flutter App Architecture: Answering the What, When and How",
    "full_abstract": "As Flutter apps grow in complexity, adopting a modular architecture becomes a critical practice to manage codebases and enable efficient feature development. It brings better code organization, team independence for feature development and testing, and separation of concerns.For Flutter applications, there are times to follow modular application architecture and times to avoid it. In this talk, we will explore what modular architecture means for Flutter, when to implement it in your apps and when not to, and how to structure your code into logical modules with concrete strategies and examples by dividing code into feature, layer, and core modules. Last but not least, you will learn best practices for module communication, state management across modules, and module-specific testing.",

    "talk_title": "Zero runtime errors: Exploring Static Code Analysis techniques in Flutter",
    "full_abstract": "If you ask a developer whether they would prefer to fix a bug or develop a new feature, there is no doubt they will select the latter.Unfortunately, bugs are part of the development cycle and are inevitable.Fortunately, there are techniques to predict and prevent them, even without running the code: with the help of static code analysis.Static code analysis is a powerful tool for finding and fixing potential errors even before compiling your code, making the cycle much faster and developers more productive. Moreover, the flexibility of this tool allows you to configure it in a way to not only control bugs but also code style and specific team practices.In this talk, we will do a deep dive into the world of static code analysis, exploring strategies on how to set it up to work best in your project, possibilities beyond `flutter_lints`, such as other libraries and 3rd party services like Dart Code Metrics, as well as what it takes to create your own custom lints for your library or app with tools such as `custom_lint`. By the end of this talk, you will be fully equipped to set up a robust static analysis system in your project and make your projects more reliable, consistent, and performant.",

    "full_abstract": "In the world of mobile app development, truly understanding and catering to your users' needs can be the difference between an app that thrives and one that just survives. In this talk, we'll focus on how to effectively gather and use feedback from users within Flutter apps, turning it from an overlooked aspect to a core part of your development process.We'll start by exploring a variety of ways to ask for feedback. We'll look at gentle, almost unnoticed prompts within the app, as well as more straightforward methods.But gathering feedback is just the beginning. Next, we'll take a deep dive into A/B testing. This is a powerful tool that can help you understand what your users prefer and how they behave. I will show you how to set up effective tests, interpret the results, and use this information to make decisions about your app.By the end of this talk, you'll have a better understanding of how to listen to your users and use their feedback to improve your app. You'll learn how to build Flutter apps that are shaped by your users' needs and wants, rather than just your initial ideas. This user-focused approach will help you create apps that your users love and keep coming back to. So, let's start listening to our users and making apps that truly meet their needs!",

    "full_abstract": "In many mobile applications, it is essential to track the user's location in order to provide a unique and personalised experience. However, gaining access to this sensitive information requires explicit permissions, especially when the goal is to track user locations even when the application is not actively running.This was the challenge I faced when working on my geofencing integration project, and I must admit that my initial expectations were not met. What I thought I could do in one day turned out to be a much more complicated task.Here are some of the topics I will cover during the talk:- An exploration of different types of permissions and best practices for requesting them- How to ask for foreground location permission with clean cross-platform code- How to ask for background permissions with clean cross-platform code- A discussion of Flutter's limitations when it comes to requesting such permissionsIn the end, you will be able to access your users' location no matter what the circumstances - or at least be able to ask for it.",

    "full_abstract": "We love Flutter, primarily because of its seamless and captivating animations. These animations don't just add visual appeal—they instil identity and authenticity into an application. Yet, persuading stakeholders or even fellow team members of their worth can be challenging. Mainly because we couldn't always estimate precisely how long a particular animation would take to implement.With this in mind, we decided to dive deep. We wanted to understand Flutter animations inside out and make them efficient, without wasting hours.For over a year now, we (Thomas and Maxime) have led company-wide Flutter animation challenges called “UI & Animations Dojos”. Our objective? To collaboratively enhance our skills and guide fellow developers in seamlessly integrating animations.Here are some of the topics we’ll tackle during the talk:- The different ways to animate Flutter recommends and how to use them in real life cases.- How to figure out if adding that fancy animation is going to blow your project timeline.- Tips to code animations faster and smarter based on a live coding session.- By the end, you'll gain a better grasp on estimating the time required to implement a specific animation, aiding in prioritising what's most essential for your application.",

    "full_abstract": "Flutter allows developing high-quality apps for multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web, and more) from a single code base. But some app functionality depends on platform-specific APIs, a requirement seemingly at odds with “one codebase for all platforms”. To bridge this gap, Flutter defines the concept of Plugins to access native apis from cross-platform code.In this talk I will build a simple Flutter app that displays a map, looks up an address (geo-coding), and plots a route (directions) with the help of two existing Flutter plugins. Both are cross-platform but under the hood make use of platform specific APIs, combining multiple platform specific solutions into a single developer friendly package. After showing how to use the Google Maps and geocoding packages in my app, I will dissect the basic structure of the two plugins and discuss how a developer might extend them, for example by adding support for a new platform.",

    "full_abstract": "Creating Dart and Flutter applications often includes typical tasks, such as implementing JSON deserialization, consuming backend APIs, creating a dependency inversion mechanism, implementing navigation and localization, managing assets, writing tests, and more. These tasks require writing repetitive code, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious. Fortunately, we can get a significant development productivity boost by letting build_runner generate all the boilerplate. But once the project grows, extensive usage of code generation brings additional challenges, such as slower generation execution, frequent merge conflicts, analyzer performance downgrade, and others.In this session, we will discuss how build_runner and different code-generating packages can facilitate many typical application development tasks, and also talk through a dozen practical tips for efficiently maintaining Dart and Flutter projects that extensively use code generation. I will not only show how to speed up the generation process, but also how to minimize chances for merge conflicts and improve overall developers’ experience.Even if you are familiar with code generation topic, you will certainly get valuable takeaways from this session!You will walk away with:- An understanding of how the code generation mechanism works- A list of useful code-generating packages worth checking out- Practical advice on how to efficiently maintain projects that extensively use code generation",

Some were developed by a single Flutter dev, some came into light through collaborative efforts across multiple teams. Each of them was different. Each of them presented unique challenges and taught us invaluable lessons.In this talk, we invite you to explore different approaches to architecting Flutter apps. Central to our narrative will be the concept of architectural drivers - key factors or priorities that steer our decisions about how the app is structured and designed. We'll show how we leverage our experience when approaching new projects. Drawing from our successes and failures, we'll present our current Flutter stack which enables us to craft robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. While there is no silver bullet for Flutter architecture, we can still have some sensible defaults. Why do we use BLoC for state management? Why not Riverpod? Why do we love hooks? What do we do to avoid re-implementing the same things over and over again? Come to our talk to find out.",

It allows to abstract styling rules from your widgets in order to keep the implementation cleaner and to prevent code repetition, other than to make life easier when the design team decided to shake things up. But here's the thing – when you dive into real-life projects, it can get a bit troublesome. Sometimes your project's design system is too complex to fit into the default Flutter theme object. Or maybe you design system and the Flutter theme object don’t semantically match up, making the design-to-code journey a bit of a head-scratcher. In this session, we're going to take a deep dive into the world of Flutter theming. I will walk you through the behind the scenes, present different approaches and uncover the potential of theme extension to finally tailor your theme object to your unique design system, so that it won't need to fit into a cookie-cutter object. Plus, I'll sprinkle in some handy tips and tricks to make your styling workflow smoother than ever.",

    "full_abstract": "This talk is meant as a fun but insightful retrospective on how we implemented (finally successful) our \"unknown\" payment provider into our app.I. It starts with the first approach which was writing a package for Android and iOS and calling the native libraries from Flutter.When we discovered that this caused too high maintenance costs we decided to switch to a browser-based implementation of the payment flow. Little did we know, how many quests we had to solve after this decision.II. Therefore, the second part of the talk superficially covers the topics WebViews, In-App browsers, Different In-App browser packages, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Functions, App Links / Universal Links vs. Deep links / Custom URL Schemes and peculiarities of our payment solution.",

    "full_abstract": "For years, accessibility features and experiences were seen as nice to have when it came to app development. Shockingly, many developers overlook this vital aspect, inadvertently excluding a significant user base. The World Health Organization reveals that about 15% of the global population, over a billion people, live with disabilities. In a digital age, it's unjust to marginalize this substantial demographic based on abilities.This talk emphasizes the critical role of accessibility in mobile apps. By introducing the innovative use of Gemini AI as an AI-powered code assistance tool in IDEs, we can address these issues head-on, ensuring that apps are accessible from the outset. Gemini AI serves as a game-changer, automating the detection and correction of accessibility issues in Flutter apps. This talk will empower developers to build apps that are inclusive and universally accessible, transforming the way we approach app design and development.",

    "full_abstract": "Flutter for Web is definitely less widespread than Flutter for mobile devices, but in my practice I have found it to be very powerful. Flutter Web has made reusing code between multiple platforms easier than ever and it enabled the use of a single frameworks across all the frontends of a project. This doesn't come without some nuances that developers should be aware of when building an app for the web.In this session I will explore those nuances starting from tips on how to create a responsive UI, and then talking about web specific concepts such as SEO (or the lack of it) and dart:js. I will also touch on how to make text selectable, and on potential issues with it.The main takeaways for the participants will be:- How to build a Responsive UI (LayoutBuilder, Wrap, Expanded, use fixed values, basic animations for UI transitions)- What is dart:js and what is dart:io -- how to conditionally import either of them- What is the state of SEO in Flutter and which are some solutions for the lack of support- Which are some issues with widgets on the web, most notably the default Text widget not being selectable",

    "full_abstract": "Form handling is a basic thing for any application. Many of them have a login one. The flutter spreads around wide variety platforms so there are definitely a form heavy apps. For example I'm currently developing one.Login like forms could be easily handled by built in flutter form engine. On the other side the complex forms require a bit different approach. Specialized form engines support a vide variety of use cases like complex validations, async validations, managing an array of entities, listening for control states and so on.I tested a lot of other packages for forms starting from native flutter forms through form_bloc and so on. My final candidate was reacitve_forms and I'm developing supportive packages to form the pleasant ecosystem around.Those packages are reacitve_forms_widgets(a 30+ ready to use widgets bindings) and reactive_forms_generator(codegen package which helps a lot with spawning the code)In my talk I would like to tell people how I'm helping to create an ecosystem for the forms, explain how anyone could use the ecosystem for complex form and how it could save the time + make the code consistent, encourage people to do the opensource.",

These apps were written in a diverse set of technologies, including Javascript, Java, Objective C, and Brightscript. We offer a range of on-demand programming for a worldwide audience that includes news, documentaries, cultural insights, and discussions on global issues in 30 languages. In addition, there are live channels in English, Spanish and Arabic.In 2023, we set off to refresh our apps technically and tailor it to the needs of our audience. An important aspect was to reduce the number of code bases. We evaluated several technologies and settled on Flutter. In 2024, we have started to roll out our new app.In this session, we take the audience on a journey into this exciting project. We will explain how we decided on Flutter, considering platform support, our own experience building native TV apps, three spike implementations, the external support we could get, plus the potential of Flutter as a key ingredient of our future app development. Starting from a UX concept for a first product increment, we developed the technical architecture, following a Clean Architecture approach. We will give an overview of our codebase, including GraphQL interface, unit, golden, and integration tests. We will also share our experience with the platforms where we already launched, including support for Spacial Navigation with TV remotes, and required performance optimizations. Finally, we will outline our plans, including integration into vendor content catalogues, a crucial building block for presence on modern TV platforms.Key takeaways:- How to decide on Flutter for an enterprise project for Connected TV- How to lay out your app architecture, following Clean Architecture- How to implement UX patterns for Connected TV like Spacial Navigation in Flutter- What pitfalls to expect when developing for TV",
