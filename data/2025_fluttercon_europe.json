    "full_abstract": "Dart is a great programming language for most apps. It's modern, strongly-typed, null-safe, and memory-safe. However, it is not particularly fast compared to other compiled languages. The solution for Flutter apps that require better performance for compute-heavy tasks is Dart Foreign Function Interface (FFI).\r\n\r\nFFI allows functions written in different languages to be called from Dart code. This means that most of the app can be written in Dart, but specific compute-intensive tasks can be implemented in a lower-level language like C, which can be up to 5x faster.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n- What is Dart FFI?\r\n- What are the limitations of Dart FFI?\r\n- How to use Dart FFI in a Flutter app\r\n- What is the difference in performance between Dart and C in real-life examples?",

In this talk, I’ll walk you through what Firebase DataConnect is and how to use it. I’ll share when it’s a good idea, when you should consider other options, and what it’s like to adopt a brand-new product. From initial excitement to moments of frustration (we even considered pulling it from production), I’ll share the full story of how we made it work.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you’ll have a clear answer to whether Firebase is the solution to your SQL vs NoSQL dilemma.",

We don’t need any parent Stack, or any layout calculation; again, just wrap with AnimatedTo.\r\n\r\nBut what makes this possible under the hood? In this session, we’ll dive into the mechanism of Flutter’s rendering pipeline from Widget to RenderObject to reveal how AnimatedTo achieves its functionality.\r\n\r\nThis talk will equip you not only with knowledge about one of the animation packages but also with a clear understanding of how you can manage “rendering” on the Flutter framework.",

    "full_abstract": "Flutter quickly became a solid technology to use in large-scale enterprise apps. However, as projects grow over time and developers are met with tight deadlines, we stumble upon the inevitable challenges related to dealing with legacy Flutter code. This is what I experienced firsthand while working on multiple projects across various business domains.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will walk you through some real-life examples of how Flutter codebases can deteriorate over time and how we effectively refactor them. We’ll tackle duplicated code, tight coupling, the lack of reusable widgets, chaotic state management, polyrepo workflow issues and much more. We’ll try to stay pragmatic though. As halting the development completely to do total refactoring is rarely an option, I would like to show strategies that can quickly bring real value without disrupting the work of the whole development team.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re just starting your project or inheriting an old codebase, refactoring patterns are a must.

And unlike back then, we now have fast, reliable, headless UI tests: Widget tests.\r\n\r\nSo why stick to outdated testing strategies, which only cover a small chunk of your app. Let’s learn how widget tests can easily cover 80% of your codebase, testing multiple screen sizes at once.\r\n\r\nThe closer your tests mirror the human interactions with your app, the better for your users. Our Plan:\r\n\r\n1. Pump your entire app: runApp(MyApp());\r\n2. Build Testing Robots (like Square does): This design pattern translates user journeys into clean, readable test code.\r\n3. Debug your tests with the new package:spot timeline, which captures every frame of your test for debugging automatically\r\n\r\nWith this setup, your widget tests become the backbone of your app, robust enough to survive even the biggest refactor. After all, app architecture is irrelevant from a user’s perspective.\r\n\r\nPascal (Flutter GDE) has been building fully-tested enterprise applications since 2015 and is a long-time contributor to the Dart testing ecosystem.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n\r\n- Rethink traditional testing strategies from 2009\r\n- Learn Full App Testing\r\n- Understand the Robot pattern\r\n- Debug widget tests visually with the Spot Timeline",

    "full_abstract": "I currently work on the development of a live streaming app, where users can both view and broadcast video streams. As you might expect, live streaming apps come with complex requirements—not only do they need to support smooth video playback and broadcasting, but also a variety of interactive features. This makes implementation particularly challenging, especially from a performance perspective.\r\n\r\nOur app is built with Flutter, and throughout its development, we’ve encountered several Flutter-specific architectural and performance problems. In addition, because we rely on iOS/Android third-party SDKs for the live streaming infrastructure, we needed to deeply integrate native components with Flutter components.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share insights from building and optimizing our live streaming app—focusing on both the architectural decisions and the performance tuning process. Topics include:\r\n\r\n1. The architecture behind video playback and broadcasting\r\n2. Techniques for using PlatformView and Texture widgets with native video players\r\n3. Our approach to measuring and improving performance\r\n\r\nThis session will include topics of both Flutter and native (iOS/Android) implementations, as the integration between them plays a critical role in the overall experience.",

    "full_abstract": "Every more advanced Flutter developer has heard of RenderBoxes, their layer, and their advantages over containing themselves just in the Widgets world. But in reality, a small number of developers have ever written one, they’re usually intimidated by the amount of boilerplate to write, and the methods to override, most with some scary-looking name. In this talk, I’ll introduce the audience to the boxy package and its CustomBoxy and BoxyDelegate classes that make taking advantage of the render object layer a very low-hanging fruit that is easy to understand, with almost no boilerplate and some advanced features if you feel like it. I’ll start by quickly reminding you how rendering widgets in Flutter works, when we need to step up the game from just the widgets layer, and what Flutter framework gives us (5 approaches of the varying magnitude of complexity) for render object layer development. Then I’ll dive in the BoxyDelegate world solving a few real-life production UI problems and I’ll talk about the pros and cons of BoxyDelegate and how I use it on a daily basis. Spoiler alert: BoxyDelegate is a wrapper on RenderObject API making it 3x more convenient to use.",

    "full_abstract": "In an increasingly connected world, users expect apps to understand where they are and adapt to their context in real time. One of the great benefits of building a mobile application is the ability to take advantage of native device capabilities, such as GPS and location permissions. By harnessing these in our apps we can provide that more contextualised experience to our users. \r\n\r\nThe question of \"Where am I?\" might be as simple as displaying a blue dot on a map. Or it might mean \"What is nearby?\". And then what happens when we move? This talk explores this concept of \"Where\", and why it matters to build apps that are location-aware. We'll be using Flutter and the ArcGIS Maps package to demo how to build apps that respond dynamically to a users position in real time, and provide more relevant and personalised experiences. You'll also learn how to create a reactive UI that updates when users enter/exit spatial zones, as well as some of the challenges and best practices when working with location data.\r\n\r\nIf you're exploring spatially-aware app development for the first time, or looking to take your existing apps to the next level, this session is for you.",
