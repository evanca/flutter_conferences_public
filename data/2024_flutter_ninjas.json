    "talk_title": "Exploring Full-Stack Dart for Firebase Server-Side Development",
    "full_abstract": "Flutter Engineer at Omiai, Inc.\n\nFlutter has revolutionized the way we build client-side applications, allowing us to create cross-platform apps swiftly with just Dart. Moreover, leveraging Firebase enables us to effortlessly utilize features like databases, authentication, and push notifications without delving into server-side development. However, when it comes to Firebase server-side processing, particularly Cloud Functions, Dart is often left out of the picture.\n\nIn this session, we will explore how to bridge this gap by utilizing various Google Cloud Platform services and tools, such as Cloud Run, Eventarc, Secret Manager, Workload Identity, and the gcloud CLI, along with the functions_framework and dart_firebase_admin packages. By doing so, we will demonstrate how Firebase server-side processing can be elegantly written in Dart, paving the way for a cohesive full-stack Dart development experience.\n\nJoin us as we delve into this exciting journey of expanding the Dart ecosystem beyond the client side, enabling Flutter developers to seamlessly integrate server-side functionalities and truly embrace the full potential of Dart in their applications.",

    "full_abstract": "Lead Mobile App Engineer at WinTicket, CyberAgent Inc.\n\nSLI/SLO is often heard as a SRE word, but it is not familiar to mobile app development. In my product, the failure rate is high, and I needed a mechanism to detect and solve the problems as early as possible. So I adapted the SLI/SLO mechanism to fit mobile apps and created a mechanism to detect poor user experience. This mechanism allows for immediate detection of the following.\n- Failure rate (cases where a certain number of users fail to use a feature due to an error or other occurrence)\n- Cancellation rate (cases where a certain number of users cancel for some reason when using a feature)\n- Suspension rate (cases where a certain number of users kill the app for some reason when using a feature)\n\nOur app has now been embedded in more than 40 features for this monitoring.\nIn this session, we will discuss the following.\n- What is SLI/SLO\n- The difference between SLI/SLO in general and SLI/SLO for user experience detection\n- How to measure cases where a user stops using a feature or crashes in the middle of a feature\n- How to set the sampling rate\n- How to create a user experience alerting infrastructure How to combat noise alerts when creating them\n- How to embed the measurement infrastructure with as little impact on the main code as possible\n- How to involve members of the business in detecting and preventing poor user experience",

    "full_abstract": "Freelance mobile apps developer\n\nOne of the most important concepts of Flutter is the \\u201cWidget tree.\\u201d Widgets\\u2019 styles are provided through the widget tree, the widget tree manages states, and rebuilds are optimized based on the mechanism of the widget tree. Understanding how widget tree works is crucial to enhancing the quality of our apps.\n\nYet, developers often explore options beyond the widget tree, such as using packages for state management, to address the challenges in development. While depending on external packages quickly solves our problems, it also introduces risks or costs of complexity and fear of breaking changes.\n\nThis session aims to demystify the widget tree's capabilities, revealing how it can solve everyday challenges.\n\nI will start by taking a closer look at the widget tree's mechanism. After that, I will explain how the Flutter framework and each widget use it internally. Finally, the session will end with the main discussion of how we can maximize the mechanism's potential.\n\nAfter listening to this session, you will be able to\n\n- Efficiently manage styling and state\n- Design your widgets to be more portable and testable\n- Reduce needless dependencies on packages\n- Easily understand Flutter docs\n\nAlthough this session doesn't introduce unique technologies or trendy packages, this section equips you with fundamental knowledge that will empower your projects across the board.",

    "full_abstract": "SWE at JP Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nFor years, accessibility features and experiences were seen as nice to have when it came to app development. Shockingly, many developers overlook this vital aspect, inadvertently excluding a significant user base. The World Health Organization reveals that about 15% of the global population, over a billion people, live with disabilities. In a digital age, it's unjust to marginalize this substantial demographic based on abilities.\n\nThis talk emphasizes the critical role of accessibility in mobile apps. By introducing the innovative use of Gemini AI as an AI-powered code assistance tool in IDEs, we can address these issues head-on, ensuring that apps are accessible from the outset. Gemini AI serves as a game-changer, automating the detection and correction of accessibility issues in Flutter apps. This talk will empower developers to build apps that are inclusive and universally accessible, transforming the way we approach app design and development.",
