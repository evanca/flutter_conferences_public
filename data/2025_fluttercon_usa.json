    "talk_title": "Writing better tests with less work",
    "full_abstract": "Many developers feel that writing tests is just busywork — a distraction from the real work of writing the code that users will run.  And they're not wrong: in too many codebases, too many of the tests really are busywork.  A busywork test doesn't meaningfully help catch bugs, and consumes effort not only to write the test but to update it again and again as things change in the codebase.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't have to be that way.  The right techniques can make a test more effective at catching bugs now, and preventing regressions next month and next year.  The same techniques can greatly reduce the burden of maintaining tests as the codebase evolves, and make the tests easier to read, with less code, even while being more comprehensive. Done right, tests are an affordable investment today that lets your team develop faster and more confidently tomorrow, and deliver a higher-quality product.\r\n\r\nThe core techniques apply in any language or framework.  Flutter offers especially rich support for writing high-quality tests right up through the UI layer, as we'll see.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll share the principles I've seen work, with practical tips and examples from real-world code:\r\n * How to choose what layer of API a given test should operate at (beyond the binary of \"unit test\" vs. \"integration test\"), to make it both low-maintenance and high-signal.\r\n * The specific tools from Flutter's rich test framework that enable writing tests at a range of different layers.\r\n * How to factor out the boring setup from each test case in ways that make the test easier to understand, not harder, and enable writing more tests with less code and less maintenance.\r\n * How to imitate Flutter's own \"binding\" system (a form of dependency injection) to let tests cleanly simulate network requests, your database, and all the Flutter plugins you use, and how to apply package:fake_async to manipulate time itself.\r\n * The package:checks library, an alternative to `expect` designed for modern Dart and backward-compatible with `expect`-style matchers.\r\n\r\nI've put these principles into practice in Zulip, and coached numerous contributors to write high-quality tests there.  Some points are inspired by my experience in the upstream Flutter tree itself, which is relentless about testing all kinds of changes, and I'll draw examples from there too.\r\n",

    "full_abstract": "Flutter Web is rapidly maturing with features like stateful hot reload and WASM compilation, but the default full-screen application model presents challenges for integration into large, existing web platforms. While iframes offer isolation, they introduce complexities in communication, styling, and context sharing. This talk is about taking a more integrated approach: embedding multi-view Flutter apps within your host web app, using custom initialization logic instead of relying on the standard generated index.html and its associated bootstrap script.\r\n\r\nWe dive into how multi-view apps allow multiple, independent Flutter components to be initialized at runtime in different parts of an existing web application. These views can share state internally, communicate with the host via JS interop and benefit from deferred imports to reduce startup times.\r\n\r\nThis session will show a case study of how we implemented multi-view embedding at Robaws to reuse an existing feature from our mobile Flutter app within our existing web application. We discuss the benefits, such as how our Web and Flutter team could continue to work independently and how this allowed us to easily add multiple other Flutter features without overhead. We also explain why we chose having 1 multi-view app over multiple smaller apps. Furthermore, the talk goes over some unintended improvements that adopting web had to our existing mobile apps, such as better support for large tablet screens.\r\n\r\nFinally, we go over some challenges when embedding existing features in a web app, such as URL strategies, using plugins that only support mobile platforms, etc). The talk will also include some practical approaches for easy development, such as using separate build modes (mocked standalone without embedding, local server with embedding, final hosting of static release build), handling JS interop for passing context like design tokens and localization, and managing potential CORS issues during development.\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at Flutter developers who want to explore the possibilities of adding Flutter to their existing web applications and will focus on less explored concepts, such as deferred imports, custom initialization and Flutter views interacting with each other and with the host web app. \r\n",

    "full_abstract": "Remember those matrix operations from school you thought you'd never use again? Dive into the world of Flutter's Matrix4 and discover how fundamental operations like scale() and transform() can bring your UI to life in ways you might not have thought of.\r\n\r\nWe'll demystify how Flutter utilizes matrix transformations, cleverly handling translation, rotation and scaling within its core mechanics. You'll learn how these are applied using the Transform widget, how to layer them effectively, and how Flutter's Axis system interacts with these transformations. Mastering these fundamentals is key to building compelling animations, smooth zooming functionalities, and other dynamic visual effects with precision.\r\n\r\nGoing beyond theory, we'll showcase real-life examples from a production application, demonstrating how these techniques are used to handle complex and performant animations and interactions. Learn practical techniques, see matrix math turn into UI magic, and equip yourself with the skills to implement visually engaging experiences in your Flutter applications.",

    "full_abstract": "Dart is a great programming language for most apps. It's modern, strongly-typed, null-safe, and memory-safe. However, it is not particularly fast compared to other compiled languages. The solution for Flutter apps that require better performance for compute-heavy tasks is Dart Foreign Function Interface (FFI).\r\n\r\nFFI allows functions written in different languages to be called from Dart code. This means that most of the app can be written in Dart, but specific compute-intensive tasks can be implemented in a lower-level language like C, which can be up to 5x faster.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n- What is Dart FFI?\r\n- What are the limitations of Dart FFI?\r\n- How to use Dart FFI in a Flutter app\r\n- What is the difference in performance between Dart and C in real-life examples?",

    "full_abstract": "Growing an Android team from a handful of developers to 50+ without imploding requires more than just good intentions—it demands architecture, automation, and guardrails that make the right decisions inevitable.\r\n\r\nAt Square, we’ve built a mobile codebase that enables teams to collaborate efficiently, share components like Lego blocks, and avoid stepping on each other’s toes—even in a 5M+ line monorepo with 100 Android ICs actively contributing everyday.\r\n\r\nBut you don’t need to be at Square’s scale to benefit. If your team is 10+ and growing, the challenges of coordination, consistency, and performance creep up fast. This talk will equip you with actionable strategies you can start implementing today to keep your engineering team productive over time.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how we:\r\n* Use a consistent UI framework to enforce strict yet flexible contracts, making UI and business logic highly composable.\r\n* Slash build times by modularizing code, separating interfaces from implementations, and structuring dependencies to minimize build times.\r\n* Ensure consistency at scale with custom lint rules and CI checks that enforce best practices. You’ll see real-world CI checks from Square that you can apply to your own projects—preventing dependency misuse, enforcing modularization, and maintaining architecture standards—to help engineers \"fall into the pit of success\" without constant oversight.\r\n\r\nThese aren’t just theories—they’re battle-tested strategies that have helped us maintain velocity without sacrificing quality. Of course, it’s not always smooth sailing. I’ll share the challenges we’ve faced, the landmines we’ve hit, and how we’ve had to pivot along the way—so you can avoid the same pitfalls.",
